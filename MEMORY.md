## What Is PlotDNA?
A real estate investment intelligence platform for India.
Users enter any location (plot/land/area) and get a **DNA Score (0–100)** showing
investment potential — based on satellite growth, infrastructure pipeline,
population trends, RERA activity, and AI analysis.

**Tagline:** *"Decode any plot before you buy."*

## Origin & Decisions Made

| Decision | Choice | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| Separate app from Structra AI? | Yes — standalone | Different users, different use case |
| App name | **PlotDNA** | `plotdna.com` available ($11.25/yr), "DNA" = strong metaphor |
| First city | **Hyderabad** | Best RERA data (TSRERA), fastest growing market, ORR boom |
| Expansion plan | Hyderabad → pan-India | Validate concept first, then scale |
| Map library | Leaflet.js + OpenStreetMap | 100% free forever, no API key needed |
| AI model | Gemini 2.0 Flash | 1500 req/day free tier |
| Satellite data | Google Earth Engine | Free non-commercial account |
| Database | Supabase | Free 500MB + PostGIS spatial queries |
| Backend | FastAPI (Python) | GEE SDK is Python-native |
| Frontend | React 19 + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind v4 | Same stack as Structra AI, familiar |

## DNA Score — How It Works
Single number 0–100 built from 7 weighted signals:

| Signal | Weight | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Infrastructure Pipeline | 25% | NHAI, Metro, Airport data |
| Population Growth | 20% | WorldPop + Census India |
| Satellite Built-up Growth | 20% | GEE Landsat/Sentinel-2 |
| RERA New Projects | 15% | TSRERA / State RERA portals |
| Employment Hub Proximity | 10% | OSM + IT park data |
| Property Price Velocity | 5% | 99acres/MagicBricks |
| Smart City / Govt Scheme | 5% | smartcities.gov.in |

**Score ranges:**
- 0–40: 🔴 High Risk
- 41–65: 🟡 Moderate
- 66–80: 🟢 Good Growth
- 81–100: 💎 Emerging Goldzone

## Design System
- **Background:** `#0a0a0a` (near black)
- **Surface:** `#111111`, `#1a1a1a`, `#262626`
- **Accent:** Green (`#22c55e`) for good scores, Red (`#ef4444`) for bad
- **Score colors:** Red → Yellow → Green → Emerald
- **Font:** Inter (system fallback)
- **Map style:** Dark tiles (CSS filter: invert + hue-rotate)
- **Popups:** Dark background `#1a1a1a`, white text, green border

---

## How to Run Locally
```bash
# Frontend (open in new terminal)
cd frontend
npm run dev
# → http://localhost:5173

# Backend (open in separate terminal)
cd backend
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate          # Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp ../.env.example ../.env     # fill in keys
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
# → http://localhost:8000
# → Docs at http://localhost:8000/docs
```

---

## Important Notes for Next Session
1. **Open Claude Code from `Desktop/PlotDNA/`** — not from Structra AI
2. First task: build `src/data/hyderabad.ts` (micro-market data file)
3. Then build: `MapView` component with Leaflet + zone polygons
4. Then build: `ScoreCard` component + `AreaDetail` page
5. Tailwind v4 uses `@import "tailwindcss"` in CSS — no config file needed
6. Path alias `@/` maps to `src/` (configured in vite.config.ts)

## 2026-03-29 High-Level Update
- PlotDNA is no longer just scaffolded. The location-intelligence flow now has real locality fallback behavior in the frontend.
- Frontend locality resolution is split into clear layers under `frontend/src/lib/location/`: contracts, resolver, and classifier.
- The fallback model is deterministic and tiered: `exact`, `nearby`, `cluster`, and `uncovered`.
- `frontend/src/lib/plotAnalysis.ts` still acts as the compatibility wrapper, so older UI flows did not need a full rewrite.
- Hyderabad resolver-facing matching data now lives in repo-local files under `data/cities/hyderabad/`:
  - `city.json` for city thresholds and center metadata
  - `localities.json` for locality polygons and centers
  - `aliases.json` for explicit locality name matching
  - `clusters.json` for broad-region membership
- The richer market dataset in `frontend/src/data/hyderabad.ts` still exists for score cards and narrative content. Resolver JSON and frontend market data are separate for now, so they must stay aligned until a later consolidation pass.
- The repo now includes `plugins/area-intelligence/` with a local skill documenting the smart locality fallback workflow and constraints.
- Backend verdict plumbing has already started reflecting fallback precision, but frontend/backend locality contracts are not fully unified yet.
- The latest local UI pass makes locality precision more honest in the plot analysis card:
  - exact shows the locality directly
  - nearby shows `Nearby: {locality}` and marks it approximate
  - cluster shows the broad region label
  - uncovered clearly says coverage is not available
- The location fallback refactor was pushed to `hotfix/url-location-resolution` at commit `b1f66f0`.
- The honest tier-label UI cleanup is currently a local working-tree change after that commit.
